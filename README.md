To use, change EXAMPLE.COM, the port number, EXAMPLEUSER, & EXAMPLEPASSWORD
to their correct values for your setup. I use cheap Hootoo-brand cameras
for my setup, yours may be different regarding snapshot urls and auth
mechanisms. Then, host this on a PHP site and access it at 
/snapshot.php?camera=1
